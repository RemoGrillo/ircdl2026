  <aside class="notes">
    The Semantic Web and Linked Open Data offer extraordinary capabilities for cultural heritage: we can model rich, typed relationships between entities and interconnect collections across institutions. However, there's a critical tension. The very expressiveness that makes LOD powerful also creates barriers. To fully exploit linked data, users need to understand SPARQL, graph structures, and ontological modeling. But the primary audiences—historians, scholars, students, the general public—rarely have this expertise. This gap is especially severe at scale: with millions of triples and thousands of interlinked entities, conventional navigation metaphors simply break down. Visualizations become congested, and semantic richness becomes a barrier rather than an asset.
