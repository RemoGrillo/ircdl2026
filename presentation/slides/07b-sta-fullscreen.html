    Here you can see the full interface of the Semantic Tree Advanced. On the left, the tree hierarchy mirrors the file system organization, with expandable nodes. Search results are highlighted directly within their archival context — the tree is "pruned" to show only relevant branches while preserving structural relationships. On the right, the metadata panel displays rich information for the selected resource, including overview, technical metadata, integrity information, and references to literary works. This is the key interface that makes 60 million triples navigable by non-technical users.
