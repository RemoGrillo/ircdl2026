    Our case study is the archive of Valerio Evangelisti, an Italian writer, historian, and political activist who lived from 1952 to 2022. He was a pioneer in using computers as creative tools since the 1980s. His archive is a fascinating hybrid collection. The digital section comprises: a main computer with over 65,000 files including novels, essays, emails, multimedia; an external hard drive with nearly 20,000 files as backup; and 389 floppy disks with early digital works from the BBS era. The analog component includes materials at the Marco Pezzi Archive and about 6,000 volumes at the university library. What makes this archive especially complex is its multiple contextual dimensions: materials relate simultaneously to political networks, academic production, literary creation, and technological evolution. The file system reaches 18 levels of depth.
